This directory contains MATLAB code and output generated for Homework 3.

INPUT
Various input as required by the scripts and functions

CODE
beautyofmath.m - MATLAB script - iterates from 1 to 9, makes some calculations as described on pages 184 - 185
prodby2.m - MATLAB function - calculates and returns the product of the odd integers from 1 to n
averageofelements - MATLAB function - calculates cummulative average of all elements in the input matrix
recpol.m - MATALB function - takes in rectagular coordinates and returns the equivalent polar coordinates
plotsin.m - MATLAB function - takes a vector, min, and max and plots the xvec points a long the sin(x) curve from min to max
classes.m - MATLAB script - takes the choice of the user from classesFunc() and prints a message based on the choice
classesFunc.m - MATLAB function - creates a menu and returns the choice of the user
TempConversion.m - MATLAB program - explainTC() has description of program
explainTC.m - MATLAB function - prints out the point of TempConversion
minmaxcheck.m - MATLAB function - prompts user for input and checks to make sure min is less than max, repeats until min is less than max
writeTemps.m - MATLAB function - writes the information to the document FahrenheitConversion.dat
HW3.m - MATLAB script - contains answers to questions that did not require other functions/scripts

OUTPUT
Some of the programs display things to command window and display figures and menus
FahrenheitConversion.dat - file contains 2 columns, first is degrees in fahrenheit, second is the toCelcius conversion

EXECTUTION
This MATLAB proram is executed by running each section in HW3.m for individual questions. Each section makes a call to the approprate function or script.
