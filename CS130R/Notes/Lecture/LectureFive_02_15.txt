Loops
For and While 
for - counted loop
while - conditional loop

for index = range
	action
end

index - loop variable
range - vector (dictates how many times a loop runs)
for loops automatically increment i based on vector of index
i is usually sqrt(-1), but we are overriding it

for i = [1:7]
	disp('Some String \n');
end

Do something with data input
Assume Vector of filepaths
	['1.dat', '2.dat', ... ]
function called myanalysis

results = zeros(1, length(filepaths)); % creates results vector for storage of data
for i = 1:length(filepaths)
	data = load(filepath(i));
	results(i) = myanalysis(data); % add the return data from myanalysis to the vector (results)
end


Nested for loops
Let's say filepaths is a 2 x N matrix

results = zeros(2, length(filepaths));
for i = 1:length(filepaths)
	data = load(filepaths(i));
	for j = 1:2 
		results(j, i) = myanalysis(data(j, :));
	end
end


while condition
	action
end

ui = input('Enter value between 0 and 9: ');
while !(ui >= 0 && ui <= 9)
	ui = input('Enter value between 0 and 9: ');
end
