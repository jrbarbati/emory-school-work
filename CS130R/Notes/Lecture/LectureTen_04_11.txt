Recursive Functions
	Function defined in terms of itself

	function factorial( n )
		if n == 0
			answer = 1;
		else
			answer = n * factorial(n - 1);
		end
	end

Sights and Sounds
	Sound Processing
		Computers measure the continuous sound waves at a constant interval -- stores the y value of the wave at the time of measurement
	
		Reading Audio Files
			[y, Fs] = audioread(filename)
				Fs -- frequency
				if length of audio is 30s and Fs is 8000Hz (s^-1)
				y would be 240000 numbers long (y is a vector)
				y can also be a matrix (p x n)
					p - sampled data
					n - # of channels
		Hearing Audio Files
			sound(y, Fs)

	Image Processing
		Sensor is broken up into pixels, pixels return the number of photons that hit is while the shutter is open
		
		Reading Image Files
			img = imread(filename) -- returns a 2D matrix if image is in greyscale
			
			RGB Images
				Red, Green, Blue
				Stored as 3D matrix, 3-2D matrices, one for each color
				Numbers stored as uint8, uint16, or doubles
				RGB values range from 0 to 255 (uint8)
			Color Map
				P x 3 matrix -- where P is the colors in the color map (all possible RGB values in the picture)
			Indexed Matrix
				Indexes row of color map
				Same dimension as picture (pixels x pixels)
				Each element in the matrix indexes the row in the color map the correlates to the color in the pixel

		Writing Image Files
			imwrite(img, filename)

		Displaying Image Files
			imshow(img) -- if img is type double, might have to scale it
			image(img)
