High level vs Low level languages
High level is more like english, can be compiled, like Java -- Source Code (high level) --> Compiler --> Object Code (low-level)
MATLAB
	Not compiled, but is a high-level language
	it is interpreted, line-by-line
	Functions
		built in (size(), length())
		can also be made, user created functions
		accept an argument and return values (most of time)
	Scripts
		sequence of MATLAB code
		e.g. format a plot
	Programs
		scripts that call functions

Program
FitByte 
	conversion from steps to miles
	ask user the number of steps they've walked in a day, and return the number of miles walked

Algorithm
	Sequence of steps to solve some problem

Top-down Approach
	break apart a problem into it's individual components
	Convert Steps to Miles
		Get # of steps from user
		convert these steps to miles
			steps to inches
			inches to miles
		report that to the user
Scope -- Local Variables
vars created in functions are only in scope in that function


fprintf --> prints to the Command window

"Congrats! You've walked __ miles"

Placeholders
%d -> for ints
%f -> for floats
%c -> for chars
%s -> for strings

%.3f --> prints the float with 3 decimal places
%3d --> always outputs an int of length 3
%-3d --> outputs an int of length three with any whitespaces following the int
Good for printing tables or other things that you want to have well-aligned

Special Characters
\n --> new line
\t --> tab
'' --> single quote
%% --> percent sign
\\ --> \
